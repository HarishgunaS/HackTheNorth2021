Connective tissue is distinguished by having relatively few cells dispersed within an abundance of extracellular material. Connective tissue connects, supports, and anchors body parts. It includes diverse structures such as loose connective tissue that attaches epithelial tissue to underlying structures; tendons, which attach skeletal muscles to bones; bone, which gives the body shape, support, and protection; and blood, which transports materials (e.g., hormones, O2) from one part of the body to another. Except for blood, the cells within connective tissue produce specific structural molecules that they release into the extracellular spaces between the cells. One such molecule is the rubber-band-like protein fibre elastin, whose presence facilitates the stretching and recoiling of structures such as the lungs, which inflate and deflate during breathing.
