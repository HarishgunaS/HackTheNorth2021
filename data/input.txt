In conclusion the Higgs Boson, an elemental display of the existence of the Higgs field, theorized in 1964 and discovered in 2012, may just be the answer to the universal question of the beginning of mass. Utilizing quantum mechanics and quantum theory to develop the standard model, where the Higgs Field is a scalar field responsible for the existence of mass. Further development and research into Higgs Boson may even lead to new theories and even never-seen before particles. Thus an exciting undiscovered future awaits researchers and physicists as they uncover the mysteries of our universe.
